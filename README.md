# Vitis Embedded Platform Source Repository

Welcome to the Vitis embedded platform source repository. This repository contains the
source code needed to recreate, modify, and extend the [Xilinx-provided Vitis embedded
platforms][3]. 

[3]: https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html

To build the Vitis embedded platforms from source code in this repository, you will need to have the following tools installed and follow the [build instructions](#build-instructions):

- A Linux-based host OS supported by Vitis
- [Vitis][1] 2024.1
- [Common Software Image](#installing-the-common-software) 2024.1

To learn how to customize Vitis embedded platforms, please refer to [Vitis Platform Creation Tutorials](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/tree/master/Vitis_Platform_Creation).

This repository is divided into two sections:

- The **Xilinx_Official_Platforms** directory contains official platform source provided by
  Xilinx. These official platforms are fully tested with all official Vitis examples, tutorials,
  etc.

- The **Xilinx_Reference_Platforms** directory contains "unofficial" platform source. These
  platforms generally exist to illustrate particular concepts, provide specific I/O interfaces
  (e.g. MIPI and HDMI), etc. They are tested with the particular examples delivered for those
  platforms and Xilinx makes an effort to ensure compatibility, but they are not regressed
  and tested to the same degree as the official platforms.

## Build Instructions

  Vitis environment need to be setup before building the platform.

  ```bash
  source <Vitis_install_path>/Vitis/2024.1/settings64.sh
  ```
  This package comes with sources to generate the Vitis platform with these steps:

  1. Generate hardware specification file (XSA) using Vivado.
  2. Generate software components of platform (using XSCT).
  3. Generate the Vitis platform by packaging hardware and software together using XSCT tool


The following table summarizes use cases of platforms build :

  |     | Build Platform with pre-built Linux |
  | --- | --- |
  | *Introduction:* | This method uses pre-built software components. Time taken for building sw components can be reduced |
  | *Requirements:* | Common Software. Use Sysroot SDK from Common Software |
  | *Pre-Synth command:* | make all PREBUILT_LINUX_PATH=<path/to/common_sw/dir> |
  | *Post-Impl command:* | make all PRE_SYNTH=FALSE PREBUILT_LINUX_PATH=<path/to/common_sw/dir> |

The platform hardware has two types.

- **Pre-Synth XSA** : Hardware specification file (XSA) in the platform does not contain bitstream. The XSA build time is quicker than Post-Impl XSA. By default, Vitis platform Makefile generates pre-synth platforms. Pre-Synth XSA is not valid for DFX platforms.
- **Post-Impl XSA** : XSA generation flow goes through implementation. The XSA contains PL bitstream and the platform generation time will be longer. 
  - DFX platforms require post-impl XSA.
  - Flat platform doesn't require post-impl XSA. If flat platform creation flow generates post-impl XSA, user can get platform resource info in platforminfo. Implementation issues may be found in early stage. It won't save time during the application v++ link phase. V++ will rerun implementation for the whole design.

> Note: For Versal platforms, the PDI in XSA will always be pre-synth PDI.


There are two methods to prepare the platform software.

- Use **Pre-built Linux** components: PetaLinux provides pre-built common software images. The image for each architecture includes Linux kernel, root file system, sysroot and common boot components like u-boot. The Vitis platform can use these components directly. Users need to [download and install common images](#installing-the-common-software) before building Vitis base platforms.
- Use **PetaLinux**: Users can use Petalinux to generate everything locally. Using this method users can customize and generate software components. Users need to install PetaLinux and setup PetaLinux environment before building Vitis base platforms. [Petalinux software components generation Tutorial][2]

The Flags used in commands of above table are explained below :

- *PREBUILT_LINUX_PATH*: By default, this flag is set to /opt/xilinx/platform/xilinx-<arch>-common-<ver>. If platform needs to be build using package located at another directory then provide the pre-built Linux image path to this flag. The build flow will generate device tree from XSA and run platform package with the pre-built Linux image. Common Linux components are provided as pre-built binaries by Xilinx to fullfill most evaluation requirements. Please refer to [UG1393- Using Embedded Platforms chapter][3] for more information. Set this flag to point common software components(u-boot, boot.scr, bl31.elf). These files are architecture specific. Zynq, zynqMP and Versal have different software component files.

    ```bash
    make all
    # Platform will be build using images found at /opt/xilinx/platform/xilinx-<arch>-common-<ver> or in current dir

    make all PREBUILT_LINUX_PATH=<common_sw_dir> 
    # This dir should contain u-boot.elf, boot.scr and bl31.elf
    ```

- *PRE_SYNTH*: This flag is used to specify XSA type that needs to be built. The default value is `TRUE`, which means pre-synth XSA is generated. To generate post-impl XSA, set this variable to `FALSE`. The build flow will run through implementation in Vivado and include implementation results to the post-impl XSA.

- *XSA*: This flag is used when building a platform with a pre-defined XSA. Example usage:

    ```bash
    make linux XSA=/home/user/<platform_dir>/vivado/build/<platform_name>.xsa
    make platform
    ```

After the build process completes, the built platform output is located at `platform_repo/<platform_name>/export/<platform_name>/` directory.


Notes:

- Building of the base platform is supported on Linux environments **only** (although it is possible to build inside a VM or Docker container), because the platform
building process involves cross-compiling in Linux.

## Installing the Common Software

Xilinx provides pre-built Common Software images so that user can skip PetaLinux project creation and build process for common usages. They can be downloaded from Xilinx Download Center under [Vitis Embedded Platform][4] tab or [PetaLinux tab][5]. Please refer to *Common images for Embedded Vitis platforms* section. 

[4]: https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html
[5]: https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools.html

The common image packages download contains these components

- Prebuilt Linux kernel
- Prebuilt root file system
- `sdk.sh` to generate sysroot
- boot files (pre-built u-boot.elf, boot.scr, bl31.elf, etc)

You can use the following command to extract the tar image.

```bash
tar -xzf xilinx-<arch>-common-<version>.tar.gz
```

To use the common software, download pre-built common images from https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html and extract the common images to /opt/xilinx/platform/ or pass it as PREBUILT_LINUX_PATH parameter make command.

## Installing the Sysroot (Yocto SDK)

Vitis applications require to build with libaries in sysroot (Yocto SDK). Sysroot can be installed from `sdk.sh`, which is included in Common Software images. Building Vitis base platforms doesn't require sysroot.

To install sysroot from `sdk.sh`, you can run the script `sdk.sh` directly.

```bash
./sdk.sh
```

You can also check the available options for scripting.

```bash
./sdk.sh --help
Usage: sdk.sh [-y] [-d <dir>]
  -y         Automatic yes to all prompts
  -d <dir>   Install the SDK to <dir>
======== Extensible SDK only options ============
  -n         Do not prepare the build system
  -p         Publish mode (implies -n)
======== Advanced DEBUGGING ONLY OPTIONS ========
  -S         Save relocation scripts
  -R         Do not relocate executables
  -D         use set -x to see what is going on
  -l         list files that will be extracted
```


To cross-compile with this SDK from the command line, run `source ./environment-setup-*-xilinx-linux` to set up your environment (cross-compile build tools, libraries, etc).
